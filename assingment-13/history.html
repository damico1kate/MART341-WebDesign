                    The first settler that was on the Sequim Prarie was a man named John W. Donnell. Donnell first came to the Dungeness area but this was too crowded for his taste so he left to find something more suitable upriver. His family and him settled down near the Dungeness river but noticed how dry Sequim was compared to other areas. Sequim has a rainshadow effect becuase of the Olympic Mountains.

                    Irrigation and the Name Sequim 
                </h2>
            <p>
                The Sequim community did not grow until after 1896 which was when the irrigation ditch was made. This let the water from the Dungeness fill the prarie lands. New settlers either started farming or opened their own businesses. In 1879 the first post office was built named Seguin. But due to postal errors this name changed to Segium which shortly turned to Sequim. To this day us residents acknowledge and celebrate an Irrigation day every year by having an irrigation parade which celebrates Sequim pride!
