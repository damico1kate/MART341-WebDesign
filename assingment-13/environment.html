           <p>
            Sequim is positioned in a way where we have the multi-faceted Olympic National Park. THe olympic mountains are a big part of Sequims environment. The Olympic Mountains are the "protectors" of Sequim since these mountains create the "Blue Hole." Blocking incoming weather which is one of the most impactful environmental factors on the coast. 
           </p>
           <h1>
            The Coast: 
           </h1>
           <img src="images/coast ss.png" width="250" height="250" alt="picture of the coast">
           <p>
            Sequim is a bay on the Olympic Peninsula. The bay rests on the Strait of Juan de Fuca of the Pacific Ocean. The coast is an important recourse for the town. We also have the Dungeness Spit wich is a thin lined beach that takes travelers out to the lighthouse. Sequim and its neighnoring area are also known for the Dungeness crab. Between activities and food the coast is a major recourse for the people.

            Forest Trails:

           <p>
            Sequim is well known for the outdoor activites residents and travelers can participate in. Along with the coast and mountains we have many forested areas which are great for hikes. Especially in the Olympic National Forest hikes more locally are the Upper Dungeness, Diamond Point trail, and the Primitive Trail Loop.

           <h1> 
            Lavendar Farms:
           </h1>
           <img src="images/lavendar ss.png" width="250" height="250 " alt="picture of lavendar">
          <p> 
          Due to the rain shadow that is created by the Olympic Mountain Range is why lavendar can grow and live in this sustanable environment. Sequim is the lavendar capital of North America and competes with France. In Sequim there are multiple lavendar farms that grow, sell, and give the lavendar experience. Every year tehre is a Lavendar Festical which includes farm tours, live music, food, and vendors. Lavendar brings the communitity together and is a staple in this small town.
