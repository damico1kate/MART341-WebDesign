Learning HTML has been a difficult learning jouney for me. At first I found coding hard to remember and couldnt connect code language to what I was seeing. Now I am having a much easier time coding for websites. I think that tutorial videos have been helpful! One thing I look forward to when coding is linking pages with the nav and the final product and that feeling when I know I did this successfully. 
I am a bit anxiouslearnign how to "decorate" html becuase I have been struggling with the styling aspect of coding. I am excited to learn and grow comfortable with the upcoming lessons.
