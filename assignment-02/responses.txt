-A directory is a fie that contains information needed to access other files and directory files. 
The relation ship between files and directories is files hold information and that file is held in a directory.
-Version control software is helpful with files that need to be worked on with multiple people. VCS helps with tracing and managing these files. 
-My favorite artistic medium is physical watercolors for painting. This is my favorite because it's familiar to me becuase my sister paints with watercolors.
