An affordance in web design terms is a action that a user can make on the web based on their own personal capabilities. An example of this is like a scroll bar and buttons. The person on the computer/device can function using these becuase of past experiences and real life. 

An advantage of using a third party platform to host your own videos would be these videos can easily be shared meaning you can have more views and connect with a wider audience. A disadvantage of this could be that site is making money off of your content as well as others can copy or give hate on your work easily.
