While browsing the web I noticed that I come across forms that I didn't know about. For example first thing when going on Safari there is a search bar which is a form. Another place on the web I see forms alot is on office 365. Another example is when sending an email. There is the box where we imput who we are sending and emial to, and as you type there are drop down boxes of who you can send mail to. As well as being able to upload files in an email. Even on moodle when signign in we have to imput passwords and we can select what courses we want to see like selecting present or past courses.
