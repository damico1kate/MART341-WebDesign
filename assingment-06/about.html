        Where did No Bake Cookies Originate?
    </h3>
   
    <p>
        No bake cookies started around the time of the depression. People who didn't have much money could make this desert by using ingredients around the house like honey to stick ingredients together. Around the 1950's this changed from a struggling desert to a treat when products like margarine, Crisco, became popular.
